          <p>
            The objectives of the <em>Game of Winter</em> are to provide the player with a cool sense of being in the story of <em>Game Of Thrones</em> and living the character's life for themselves. The player will go through many stages/levels of the game unlocking rewards for each one. The story line will go as in the <em>HBO's Game Of Thrones</em> story line. We will try to mimic and bring from the seasons to life the best we can. The players will play to their deaths.
          </p>
          <p>
            As Queen Cersei says in season one, "When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die. There is no middle ground."
