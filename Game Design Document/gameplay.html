            As the book and the series game of thrones had a massive following and would be keen to watch and play the series adaption. Another audience would be fans of Lord of the rings with the fantasy elements and both being great books then adapted to film/series. The main audience are the fans/stans of the series <em>Game of Thrones</em>. So as the series and book had a huge impact on the people and they like to watch and read it so we decided to make a game of it so from that they must like to play it as it includes the 2 main characters of the series Dany and John Snow. So main objective is the audience they will surely like it.

            As Queen Cersei says in season one, "When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die. There is no middle ground."
