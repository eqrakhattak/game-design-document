            As the game <em>Game of Winter</em> is based on the show <em>Game Of Thrones</em>, the story line of the 2 charactersin the game would be according to the series. Dany and John will go on with thier lives in each level as they did in the show, facing all those difficulties and challenges that they faced in the series. The war, the winter, the army of the dead, the power struggle are all there.

            In this version of the game, we will see the 2 main characters and their lives from the series. Daenerys Targaryen and Jon Snow. The players will play to their deaths (in Dany's case) or banishment (in John's case) as in the series. A certain death may occur if deviated from the orignal story path.
