            The game <em>Game of Winter</em> is based on the show <em>Game Of Thrones</em>. Game of Thrones is an HBO series that tells the story of a medieval country's civil war. When the story begins, a decade-long summer is ending, and winter looms as characters battle to claim the "Iron Throne," the seat of the king of the Seven Kingdoms, the regime that rules all but the northern tip of Westeros. Every character has different story and they faced different challenges.
          </p>
          <p>
            Game of Winter basically tells and shows the lives of different characters in <em>Game of Thrones</em> and depicts the challenges that they faced as game levels. The player selects the character, from the menu, he wants to play as. the game starts from the beggining of the character's life in the show. A story line with levels based on challenges each time harder than the one before according to the GOT Series.<br>
            In this version of the game, we will be taking things slow and only integrate 2 main characters and their lives from the series. Daenerys Targaryen and Jon Snow. The players will play to their death (in Dany's case) or banishment (in John's case) as in the series.

            As Queen Cersei says in season one, "When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die. There is no middle ground."

            GOT is about what happens when 7 kingdoms/players play the <em>GAME OF THRONES</em>. <br>
            It's a not easy to describe GOT, other than to say it's awesome. It's a fantasy world which has action, adventure, thriller, suspense, politics. It has everything, from sex/nudity to heads being crushed/burned/decapitated, from witty acerbic humor, about love and about revenge, and any thing else u can think about.<br>
            The show is a must watch and is filled with action, suspense, conspiracy theories, betrayal,lust for power.The show is basically about seven noble families fighting over the land of Westeros. Everything in that show is perfect. It almost covers every genre.
          </p>
